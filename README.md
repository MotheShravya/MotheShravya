<!--
**MotheShravya/MotheShravya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a passionate engineering student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong addiction to AI and ML tasks. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ğŸŒ± Currently Learning: Delving deeper into advanced concepts in deep learning such as GANs, reinforcement learning, and neural architecture search.

ğŸ‘¯ Looking to Collaborate On: Open-source projects related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects that leverage AI for solving real-world problems in domains like healthcare, finance, and sustainability.

ğŸ¤” Looking for Help With: Optimizing model performance, deploying ML models in production environments, and exploring best practices in AI/ML engineering.

ğŸ’¬ Ask Me About: Machine learning algorithms, Python programming, AI project ideas, or anything related to my experiences with AI/ML tasks.

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: SHE/HER

âš¡ Fun Fact:I once trained a neural network to generate poetry, and it actually won a local poetry contest!

Thanks for stopping by! Let's connect and collaborate on some exciting AI/ML projects together! ğŸš€
